    %h2 TECHNO EXPERTS!!
    %p
      The NoAgenda Dashboard works best on late model Chrome/Firefox/Safari/IE browsers
      It also works pretty darn good on the iPad. A special version for Android and iPhone devices
      is still in the works.
    %p
      If you have any issues with this app, or any suggestions to make, you can post them on the
      %a{:href=>'https://github.com/tardate/noagenda_dashboard/issues', :target=>'_blank'}github project issues
      page.
    %p
      The app is fully open-source. If you'd like to help with any design, development, or
      internationalization (translations), you are most welcome. Come see the project on
      %a{:href=>'https://github.com/tardate/noagenda_dashboard', :target=>'_blank'}Github

    %h2 The API
    %p
      Yes, the app has a simple REST API to get at the underlying data: show, meme and shownotes data.
      You are welcome to slurp on the API if you are building something else and want a dead simple way
      of getting all the show details in an organized fashion.
    %p
      Here's a quick run down of some of the main data sets available.
      These examples show requests for json format data.
      You can get data in XML - simply replace .json with .xml
    %ul
      %li http://noagendadashboard.com/shows.json - gets all the shows
      %li http://noagendadashboard.com/shows/333.json - gets show number 333 (for example)
      %li http://noagendadashboard.com/shows/333/memes.json - gets all the memes on show number 333
      %li http://noagendadashboard.com/shows/333/notes.json - gets all the notes for show number 333
      %li http://noagendadashboard.com/memes.json - gets all the memes
      %li http://noagendadashboard.com/notes.json - gets all the notes
    %p
      There's more we can do with the API (e.g. searching), but currently incomplete and/or nodoc;-)
    %p
      If you need something more from the API, or there are any problems, then drop by the
      %a{:href=>'https://github.com/tardate/noagenda_dashboard/issues', :target=>'_blank'}github project issues
      page and we can discuss.
